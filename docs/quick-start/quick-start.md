# Quick Start

This section mainly starts by quickly starting services such as api/rpc to let everyone have a macro concept of the project developed with go-zero, and we will introduce them in more detail in the follow-up. If you have already prepared the environment and tools with reference to [prepare](../prepare/prepare), please follow the following sections to start the experience:

* [monolithic service](monolithic-service)
* [micro service](micro-service)
